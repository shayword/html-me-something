<article>Arkansas born and raised. I grew up in a small town named Jonesboro, which was surrounded by farms and hordes of mosquitoes. Despite that it was a pleasant town with some good hearted people and a warm glow to it.
I started working on my first computers here at the age of 8 and I haven't stoppe since.<br><br><br>

Texas, home of the....George Bush. My father ran the Dupont plants in the south and Texas was Headquarters. I was too young to remember this time in my life but I do know it was very brief. I think we stayed 2 months and moved back
to Jonesboro. We were robbed twice during the time. Can't really recommend that.<br><br><br>

Arizona, what a beautiful place. I moved to Tempe, Arizona in 2004 to attend a college called UAT. I studied Game Design, Project Managment, Network Security, and Programming. It was a very good experience and I made a lot of friends
there. I highly recommend anyone to visit this place.<br><br><br>

Missourri, crazy *** weather. I moved here a couple months ago to attend LaunchCode, actually! So far so good! St. Charles is VERY accomodating and beautiful to boot.
