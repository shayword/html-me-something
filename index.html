          <h2>Arkansas</h2>
          <p>Arkansas born and raised. I grew up in a small town named Jonesboro, which was surrounded by farms and hordes of mosquitoes. Despite that it was a pleasant town with some good hearted people and a warm glow to it.
          I started working on my first computers here at the age of 8 and I haven't stoppe since.</p>

          <h2>Texas</h2>
          <p>Texas, home of the....George Bush. My father ran the Dupont plants in the south and Texas was Headquarters. I was too young to remember this time in my life but I do know it was very brief. I think we stayed 2 months and moved back
          to Jonesboro. We were robbed twice during the time. Can't really recommend that.</p>

          <h2>Arizona</h2>
          <p>Arizona, what a beautiful place. I moved to Tempe, Arizona in 2004 to attend a college called UAT. I studied Game Design, Project Managment, Network Security, and Programming. It was a very good experience and I made a lot of friends
          there. I highly recommend anyone to visit this place.</p>

          <h2>Missouri</h2>
          <p>Missourri, crazy weather, but not so much different than Arkansas. I moved here at the end of 2016 to attend LaunchCode, actually! So far so good! St. Charles is VERY accomodating and beautiful as well.</p>
